min_var_math.pdf -- Contains the math behind the minimum variance portfolio calculation

Optimal port.py -- Contains the calculation of optimial portfolio and the reference optimal portfolio. The file also contains our portfolio's efficient frontier plot and the reference portfolio's efficient frontier plot. The frontiers and optimal portfolios are generated using a Monte Carlo simulation.  


min_var_portfolio.py -- Contains the calculation of the minimum varaince portfolio, found using the gradient descent method and the method of lagrange multipliers. 

pd_finance.py -- automating the code for optimal portfolio calculation and minimum variance calculation. The purpose of this program is to generate portfolios based on the stocks selected by the user and calcualate the statistics of that portfolio, such as returns, risks, etc. The idea of the program is to allow users to use tools such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, MatPlotLib, etc... without needing to know how to program in Python. 


Main Objective :  Create a LSTM neural net that detects hidden seasonality trend in stocks. Once the net is developed, I would like to use the detected periodicity of the stocks to apply technical analysis techniques such as hedging to increase portfolio returns. 

Current Step : writing a program for a general PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) in Python. I have not been able to the find the tool in any Python library, so I thought I might want to write it and put it online for anyone to use.
